# Kiso

Kiso is a modern, customizable, and highly flexible component library for Next.js applications. It is built using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI.

For incremental adoption or to suit your project's needs, feel free to just copy the code for each component individually if you don't want to install all the dependencies.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for safer and more predictable code.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Radix UI**: A low-level UI primitive library for building high-quality, accessible design systems.

## Getting Started

1. Install the kiso library in your Next.js project.

   ```sh
   npm install kiso
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn add kiso
   ```

2. Import the required components from the library and use them in your project.

   ```jsx
   import { ToggleGroup, ToggleGroupItem } from "kiso-core";
   ```

Alternatively

```jsx
import {
  ToggleGroup,
  ToggleGroupItem,
} from "kiso-core/toggle-group";
```
