# Maison Components

Maison Components is a modern, customizable, and highly flexible component library for Next.js applications. It is built using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI.

This has a lot of requirements but feel free to just copy the code for each component individually if you don't want to install all the dependencies.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for safer and more predictable code.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Radix UI**: A low-level UI primitive library for building high-quality, accessible design systems.

## Getting Started

1. Install the maison-components library in your Next.js project.

   ```sh
   npm install maison-components
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn add maison-components
   ```

2. Import the required components from the library and use them in your project.

   ```jsx
   import { ToggleGroup, ToggleGroupItem } from "maison-components-core";
   ```
