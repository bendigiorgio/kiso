# Maison Components

Maison Components is a modern, customizable, and highly flexible component library for Next applications. It is built using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI.

There are a lot of dependencies but feel free to just copy the code for each component individually if you don't want to install all the dependencies.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for safer and more predictable code.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Radix UI**: A low-level UI primitive library for building high-quality, accessible design systems.

## New Components

I am constantly trying to add new components to this library. If you have any suggestions or requests please feel free to open an issue or PR. I do however, want to ensure that the library doesn't become too cluttered.

## Prebuilt Pages

These pages aren't really components but they are useful for quickly building out pages. They are not exported from this library as they already have placeholder content added. To use these pages please go to the Story for each page, copy the code and adjust to your needs.

### Future

- Add more components
- Improve documentation
- Create more comprehensive tests
- Separate into modules, i.e. `maison-components/core`, `maison-components/prebuilt`, `maison-components/utils`, etc.

## Thanks

A massive thanks to shadcn this is the basis for many of the components in this library. It provides amazing components and if you're looking to incrementally add components and want more control over the styling I would highly recommend checking it out.
