# Prebuilt

## Purpose

These prebuilt components can be seperated into two main categories: **Pages** and **Variable**. All prebuilt components that are not found within the pages directory are **variable** components, in that they will take in props to generate their appearance.

**Page** components however are just that, pages/sections. They are prebuilt pages that can be used as is, or as a starting point for your own custom pages.

## Usage

These components aren't exported from any package and to use them you should copy the source code to your own project. You can then modify them as you see fit.

I have chosen this method as they should be used as a starting point for your own custom components/sections, and not just as a dependency. However, it is perfectly fine to use the **variable** components as is.

See [source code]("https://github.com/bendigiorgio/kiso/tree/main/src/docs/src/prebuilt").
