# Maison Components

Maison Components is a modern, customizable, and highly flexible component library for Next.js applications. It is built using TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI.

This has a lot of requirements but feel free to just copy the code for each component individually if you don't want to install all the dependencies.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for safer and more predictable code.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Radix UI**: A low-level UI primitive library for building high-quality, accessible design systems.

## Thanks

A massive thanks to shadcn this is the basis for many of the components in this library. It provides amazing components and if you're looking to incrementally add components and want more control over the styling I would highly recommend checking it out.
